TeamWall
========

The idea of this prohect is to make a tool that could combine and thus replace
Skype team chats with blogging in a real-time manner for intranet sites. It will inspire
knowledge sharing and collaboration.

Typical use cases
-----------------

* Links/media/files sharing about books, new features, etc (would be nice to have "share to teamwall" js snippet)
* Write blog posts about personal achievemnts or nice developments
* Private group (team) chat for various non-work related stuff
